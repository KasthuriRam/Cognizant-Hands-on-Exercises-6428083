Big O Notation:

Big O describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.
It helps predict how performance degrades as input size increases.
It ignores constants and lower-order terms to focus on growth rate.
Best, Average and Worst Case for Searching: Linear Search - O(1) is best case, O(n/2) is avergae case and O(n) is worst case. Binary Search - O(1) is best case, O(log n) is average case and O(log n) is worst case.

Analysis: Use binary search if:

You can keep the product list sorted.
You have a large number of products.
Use linear search if:

The product list is small.
Frequent insertions and deletions happen.
