Big O Notation:
  1. Big O describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.
  2. It helps predict how performance degrades as input size increases.
  3. It ignores constants and lower-order terms to focus on growth rate.
  
Best, Average and Worst Case for Searching:
    Linear Search -	O(1) is best case,	O(n/2) is avergae case and O(n) is worst case.
    Binary Search	- O(1) is best case, O(log n)	is average case and O(log n) is worst case.

Analysis:
Use binary search if:
  1. You can keep the product list sorted.
  2. You have a large number of products.
     
Use linear search if:
  1. The product list is small.
  2. Frequent insertions and deletions happen.
